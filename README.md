# Band Tribute Website

This is my second HTML challenge - a simple multi-page website.

## Description

The challenge was to create a simple multi-page website for a band, including Navigation Bar with links to Homepage, Discography and Bio.

The Homepage was to include a photo and brief description. 

The Discography page was to include the band's studio albums in order of release, with an album cover and track listing.

The Bio page was to show an unordered list of band members, with a photo, name, and instrument for each.

I had to include a footer with my copyright.
